# Exercise 2 - create a variable named capitalized_fruits and use list comprehension syntax to produce output like ['Mango', 'Kiwi', 'Strawberry', etc...]. Hint: Use <string>.capitalize()

# Exercise 3 - Use a list comprehension to make a variable named fruits_with_more_than_two_vowels. Hint: You'll need a way to check if something is a vowel.

# Exercise 13 - Make a variable named negative_numbers that holds only the negative numbers
negative_numbers = [number for number in numbers if number < 0]

# Exercise 14 - use a list comprehension w/ a conditional in order to produce a list of numbers with 2 or more numerals
numbers_with_2_or_more_numerals = [number for number in numbers if len(str(abs(number))) >= 2] # counts length of number as str, but without the "-"

# Exercise 15 - Make a variable named numbers_squared that contains the numbers list with each element squared. Output is [4, 9, 16, etc...]
numbers_squared = [number**2 for number in numbers]

# Exercise 16 - Make a variable named odd_negative_numbers that contains only the numbers that are both odd and negative.
odd_negative_numbers = [number for number in numbers if number%2 == 1 and number < 0]
